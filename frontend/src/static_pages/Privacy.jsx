          verify your age when you register for an account with us.
        </p>
        <h2>Sharing of Personal Data</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell your personal data to any third parties. We may share
          your personal data with our carefully selected third party service
          providers who help us provide our services to you, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our logistics/warehouse service provider.</li>
          <li>Our couriers and similar delivery companies.</li>
          <li>Our payment providers.</li>
          <li>
            Our professional partners, including our marketing agencies and
            website hosts.
          </li>
          <li>Our customer service providers.</li>
          <li>Our analytics providers.</li>
          <li>Our IT and technical service providers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In certain circumstances we may also need to share your personal data
          with our legal advisers, bankers, auditors and insurers and our
          regulators, including HM Revenue &amp; Customs and with any third
          parties to who we choose to sell or transfer any part of our business
          or assets.
        </p>
        <p>
          We require all third parties to respect the security of your personal
          data and to treat it in accordance with the law. We do not allow our
          third party service providers to use your personal data for their own
          purposes and only permit them to use your personal data for specified
          purposes and in accordance with our instructions.
        </p>
        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          Many of our external third party service providers are based outside
          the EEA so their processing of your personal data will involve a
          transfer of data outside the EEA.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a
          similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least
          one of the following safeguards is implemented:
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <li>
          The country to which the data is transferred has been deemed to
          provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the
          European Commission.
        </li>
        <li>
          We have implemented specific contracts approved by the European
          Commission which give personal data the same protection it has in
          Europe.
        </li>
        <p>
          Please contact us if you want further information on the specific
          mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the
          EEA.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
          We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
          personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an
          unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access
          to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
          other third parties who have a business need to know such information.
          They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they
          are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal
          data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a
          breach where we are legally required to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our website and app may include links to third-party websites,
          plug-ins and apps. Clicking on those links or enabling those
          connections may allow third parties to collect or share data about
          you. We do not control these third-party websites and are not
          responsible for their privacy statements. When you leave our website
          and app, we encourage you to read the privacy notice of every website
          and app you visit.
        </p>
        <h2>How long will we keep your information for?</h2>
        <p>
          We will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to
          fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of
          satisfying any legal, accounting or reporting requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will retain your name, email address, address, phone number, date
          of birth, gender, details of previous purchases, searches and items
          saved in your wish list, which we collect when you hold an account
          with us for such time as you continue to hold an account with us.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will retain your name, email address, delivery address and billing
          address which you provide to us when you make a purchase on our
          website or app and all our correspondence with you for seven years
          following your last purchase or contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will treat your payment information in line with the PCI DSS
          standards which are recognised worldwide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where you register to receive our latest news, products and offers, we
          will keep your contact details (generally your email address and/or
          phone number) for such time as you wish to continue to receive such
          updates from us. We monitor how you engage with our emails and other
          electronic messages, and if you don’t open an email or message for 12
          months you’ll automatically fall into a 30 day inactive program. If
          you’re still not active on email or messaging following this period,
          we’ll retire your contact details and stop contacting you with
          marketing. Alternatively you can “opt out” to stop receiving marketing
          emails within 24 hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may need to retain your personal data for other purposes, e.g.
          operating your account or dealing with any enquiry you have made.
        </p>
